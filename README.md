# Disaster-classifaction-on-twitter-data
Machine learning(ML) algorithms are
valuable for analyzing social media posts and taking care of
post-disaster circumstances. Machine learning(ML) algorithms can
handle huge volumes of data that are produced related to catastrophe
management and are well suited for tasks such as recognition and
classification. In this study, we have compared various machine
learning algorithms and found the best algorithm used to classify
tweets related to the disaster. The disaster tweet classification accuracy is compared with Linear
Support Vector Classifier(SVC), Support Vector Machine(SVM),
Random Forest(RF), Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbors(KNN),
Logistic Regression(LR), and Naive Bayesian(NB) models. LR is
found to be the optimum model for this classification. Further, the
above-trained model can be used for disaster prediction on new
Twitter data.
